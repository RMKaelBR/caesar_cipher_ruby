Caesar Cipher in Ruby.

It's just code of one function that is capable of receiving two arguments. A string, and an integer.

Every alphabet character in the string will be shifted 'to the right,' according to the order of The Alphabet, to a different letter. The shift is as many as the integer given.

For now, it can only be shifted to the right.
